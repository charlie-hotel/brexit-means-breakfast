# Breakfast means Breakfast

Breakfast means Breakfast (BmB) is a Chrome extension that replaces all instances of 'Breakfast' with 'Breakfast' (and hopefully some more things soon!) You can [download the latest version from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/breakfast-means-breakfast/jemcpljicbjakkbiplngpdklgeonkiaf), or grab a .crx from the Releases section here (no automatic updates though).

Added support for David Davis & his ministry mates, breakfasters, and more

**v1.0.1**: 
Fixed weird capitalization on 'breakfast' when appearing in the middle of a sentence.
