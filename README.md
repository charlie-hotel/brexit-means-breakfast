# Brexit means Breakfast

Brexit means Breakfast (BmB) is a Chrome extension that replaces all instances of 'Brexit' with 'Breakfast' (and hopefully some more things soon!) You can [download the latest version from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/brexit-means-breakfast/jemcpljicbjakkbiplngpdklgeonkiaf), or grab a .crx from the Releases section here (no automatic updates though).

# Releases and Changelog
**v1.0.2**:

This is all made possible by the fantastic [Millenials to Snake People](https://github.com/ericwbailey/millennials-to-snake-people) extension.
